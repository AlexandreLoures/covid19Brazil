The `covid19brazil` R package has daily information on the number of accumulated cases and accumulated deaths for the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. The information available in the package is organized as follows:

* `brazil_total` - Dataset with information about the new Coronavirus (COVID-19) for Brazil as a whole
* `brazil_region` - Dataset with information on the new Coronavirus (COVID-19) for the five regions of Brazil
* `brazil_state` - Information on the new Coronavirus (COVID-19) for the twenty-seven Federative Units of Brazil
* `brazil_municipality` - Information on the new Coronavirus (COVID-19) for the 5,570 municipalities in Brazil

The graph below shows the number of cases accumulated in each Federative Unit of Brazil per 100,000 inhabitants (data for the day 2022-06-24).
