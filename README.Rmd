<!-- badges: end -->

The `covid19brazil` R package has daily information on the number of accumulated cases and accumulated deaths for the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. The information available in the package is organized as follows:

* `brazil_total` - Dataset with information about the new Coronavirus (COVID-19) for Brazil as a whole
* `brazil_region` - Dataset with information on the new Coronavirus (COVID-19) for the five regions of Brazil
* `brazil_state` - Information on the new Coronavirus (COVID-19) for the twenty-seven Federative Units of Brazil
* `brazil_municipality` - Information on the new Coronavirus (COVID-19) for the 5,570 municipalities in Brazil

## Base limitation:

**At the municipal level, the current day's data may be lower than the previous day's: this happens because the notification municipality is not necessarily the same place of residence of the notified case or death. Thus, upon completing the investigation process of each individual occurrence, the Municipal and State Health Departments have the autonomy to correct the information and pass it on to the Ministry of Health. Therefore, in all bases the current day's data may be smaller than the previous day's data.**

# Installation

To install the `package`, one of the two standard methods for installing `packages`in R can be adopted. Directly through the [cran](https://cran.r-project.org/package=covid19brazil) (choosing the closest repository):

``` r
install.packages ("covid19brazil")
```

Or even using the command below. In the latter case, the latest version of the `package` will be installed.

``` r
# install.packages ("devtools")
devtools::install_github ("AlexandreLoures/covid19brazil")
```
# The update_data command

To obtain the most up-to-date version of the data on the new coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in Brazil, use the `update_data` command. Data is updated daily on [Github (Dev) version](https://github.com/AlexandreLoures/covid19brazil), however, the [CRAN version](https://cran.r-project.org/package=covid19brazil) of the `covid19brazil` package is updated every month or two. **Don't forget to restart the R session to load the new data**.

```r
update_data ()
```

# Using the package

```{r}
data ("brazil_total")

head (brazil_total)
```

# Download, read and analyze the microdata

The purpose of this section is to analyze data on cases, deaths, proportions and geographic distribution on the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, made available by the [Ministerio da Saude - Sistema Unico de Saude (SUS)](https://www.gov.br/saude/pt-br). Data are available as of 2020-01-30, when the first suspected case appeared in Brazil.

## Cases accumulated per 100,000 habitants

The graph below shows the number of cases accumulated in each Federative Unit of Brazil per 100,000 habitants (data for the day 2022-08-15).

## Deaths accumulated per 100,000 habitants

In turn, the next graph shows the number of deaths accumulated in each Federative Unit of Brazil per 100,000 habitants (data for the day 2022-08-15).
